					<h2>The Game</h2>
						<p class="bb">
							To me ultimate frisbee is all about having fun with your teammates. 
							There's nothign better than winning a game or a tournament with the team.
							The number of players each team can have on the field at one time is 7. 
							The game starts when one team <b>pulls</b> to the other team. The first team to score 15 points wins the game. 
							When you catch or pick up the disc you have to stay still. If you get the disc and start moving with it, 
							it's a travel and the player has to go back to the spot where he cautgh the disc. You can pivot with the disc though.
							
						</p>					
					<h2>Scoring</h2>
						<p class="bb">
							In order to score a point, the offensive team has to work the disc down the field into the opposing team's endzone.
							The defensive team can also score if they get a <b>callahan</b>, 
							which can be done by intercepting the disc in the opposite team's end zone while they are on offense. 
						</p>

					<h2>The Force</h2>

							<br/>
							This is a basic mark on a defender. 
							Force just means which side of the field you are forcing the person throwing the disc (handler) to throw the disc.
							The three types of forces are home, away, or straight up. Forcing home means that the handler is being forced to throw a back-hand. 
							Forcing away means that the handler is being forced to throw a flick. 
							Forcing straight up means that the defender is marking right in front of you and trying to block you both ways.
						</p>
					<h2>Turnovers</h2>
						<p class="bb">
							When you recieve the disc, you have ten seconds to pass it to one of your teammates if you are being defended.
							This is called a <b>stall count</b> and when you get stalled you lose possession of the disc to the defense.
							The defense can also force a turnover by intercepting the disc, forcing a throw away, or by blocking the disc.
							Also if the offensive team drops the disc or throws the disc out of bounds it's also a turnover.

					<h2>Skying</h2>

							In ultimate when you catch the disc over a defender it's called a <b>sky</b>.
