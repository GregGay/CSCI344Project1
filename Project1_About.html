					<h2>The Game</h2>
						<p class="bb">
							To me ultimate frisbee is all about having fun with your teammates. 
							There's nothign better than winning a game or a tournament with the team.
							The number of players each team can have on the field at one time is 7. 
							The game starts when one team pulls the disc to the other team. Pulling means throwing the disc from your endzone to your opponents endzone. 
							The first team to score 15 points wins the game. 
							When you catch or pick up the disc you have to stay still. If you get the disc and start moving with it, 
							it's a travel and the player has to go back to the spot where he cautgh the disc. You can pivot with the disc though.
							<img src="ProjectPics/onFieldAction.jpg" alt="Stalling" width="300" height="225" align="left" />
							<br/>
							The most common plays on offense are the vertical stack and horizontal(also called ho-stack) stack.

								<div class="modal-body">

										<img src="ProjectPics/v.gif" alt="Stalling" width="138" height="317" align="left" />
										<b>The objective of the vertical stack is to get everyone in a vertical line in the center of the field 
										so that the rest of the field isn't a huge cluster of people running around trying to get the disc.
										The person at the back of the stack(with the red arrow) has the priority cut. 
										This cutter should fake like he's going out towards the endzone to fake out the defender, then cut in hard to the disc in the open space of the field.
										If the cutter doesn't get the disc thrown to him, then he should run back into the stack.
										Everyone in the middle of the stack should just stay put until they make their way to the back of the stack.
										The person on the front of the stack(purple arrow) can make a cut to the closed side of the field or to the endzone.
										The person behind the handler is considered a dump because they are near the handler so that if the handler is close to stall 10 he can throw it to the dump.</b>

										<b>The objective of the defense, as always if to force a turnover by using the cup to force the handler to throw the disc to one side of the field.
										The offense has four lanes to work with, as you can see. The insider cutters(lanes 2 and 3) have the priority cut. 
										So once one of the cutters makes his cut the other cutter makes a cut opposite to his cut. 
										For example, if the cutter in lane 3 makes a cut to the disc, then the cutter in lane 2 cuts towards the endzone.
										Same thing with the the outside cutters(lanes 1 and 4). If the cutter in lane 3 goes to the disc, 
										then the cutter in lane 1 also cuts to the disc and the cutters in lanes 2 and 4 cut towards the endzone.</b>

										<img src="ProjectPics/zone.png" alt="Stalling" width="172" height="400" align="left" /> 
										<b>The objective of the defense, as always if to force a turnover by using the cup to force the handler to throw the disc to one side of the field.
										If the zone defense works it can really put teh handlers in a bind causing turnovers.
										The offense, on the other hand, has to work the disc up the field with their handlers, 
										by taking care of the disc and making smart throws and finding holes in the cup to throw to the poppers. 
										If the offensive handlers work well with each other by swinging(passing) the disc to one another, 
										they will eventually tire out the cup and easily find their open poppers and deeps.
										The poppers are the offensive players in the middle of the zone. 
										It is very important for the poppers to find holes in the cup and if this works successfully the disc gets worked up the field pretty quick. 
										The other two players are deeps.
										They are responsible for making oppostie cuts, one going towards the endzone and the other towards the disc, to spread out the deep defender.

							So these are the basic offensive and defensive strategies that you'll see in a game.
							These plays can be confusing at first, but once you get out to pracitce and get a better understanding for the game this will all become second nature.

					<h2>Scoring</h2>
						<p class="bb">
							In order to score a point, the offensive team has to work the disc down the field into the opposing team's endzone.
							The defensive team can also score if they get a callahan, 
							which can be done by intercepting the disc in the opposite team's end zone while they are on offense.
						</p>
					<hr/>
					<h2>The Force</h2>
						<p class="bb">
							<img src="ProjectPics/Stalling.jpg" alt="Stalling" width="285" height="225" align="left" />
							<br/>
							This is a basic mark on a defender. 
							Force just means which side of the field you are forcing the person throwing the disc (handler) to throw the disc.
							The three types of forces are home, away, or straight up. Forcing home means that the handler is being forced to throw a back-hand. 
							Forcing away means that the handler is being forced to throw a flick. 
							Forcing straight up means that the defender is marking right in front of you and trying to block you both ways.
						</p>
					<hr/>
					<h2>Turnovers</h2>
						<p class="bb">
							When you recieve the disc, you have ten seconds to pass it to one of your teammates, if you are being defended. 
							This is called a stall count and when you get stalled you lose possession of the disc to the defense.
							The defense can also force a turnover by intercepting the disc, forcing a throw away, or by blocking the disc.
							Also if the offensive team drops the disc or throws the disc out of bounds it's also a turnover.
							So it is very important to take care of the disc.
						</p>

					<h2>Skying & Layouts</h2>
						<p class="bb">
							<img src="ProjectPics/skying_fools.jpg" alt="Me skying fools!" width="176" height="272" align="left" />
							In ultimate when you catch the disc over a defender it's called a sky. 
							It's always a great accomplishment when you can go up against someone and come down with the disc, and your teammates love it.
							An even better accomplishment and probably the best play to make in ultimate is the layout. It is also one the hardest plays to make.
							Getting a successful layout takes good timing and a good read on the disc. 
							In order to do it, you have to jump horizontally with one hand extented out to catch the disc, then land on your chest.
							It's a hard thing to accomplish at first and takes a lot of practice, but when you finally do it, it's a great feeling.

					<h2>Tips</h2>
						<p class="bb">
							<img src="ProjectPics/croc-frisbee.jpg" alt="croc-frisbee" width="285" height="214" align="left" />
							<br/>
							This sport is a very competitive sport, but the main thing to remember is to always have fun. You should never play a sport if you don't intend to have fun.
							When you get the disc don't get nervous and think you have to get rid of the disc, instead take a deep breath and take your time with the disc. 
							You have ten seconds with the disc, which is a lot of time make a smart play and find an open player.
